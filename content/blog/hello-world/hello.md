Forget not your true nature!

```poetry
“Forget safety.
Live where you fear to live.
Destroy your reputation.
Be notorious.” 
        ― Rumi
```

```poetry
Here I always smell,
	chicken broth in the morning.
What a strange breakfast.

This type of work
	is always quite painful,
like a constant throbbing
	in my brain, a slow burn.
	

There is an eternal endless mall,
		the mall of pleasures.
	In it a shop sells sweets.

Outside stringy,
not chewable,
but inside are divine atoms

Scene from a dream:
I jumped into the dirty,
canal boat water.
	The water here was thirsty,
	I gave myself for slaughter.
```
